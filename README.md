This is a flowfield visualizer based on this one: https://github.com/kgolid/p5ycho/tree/master/topology5

I've added a few tweaks and made most of the parameters changeable via a form. It seems to be p5 draw speed limited, so I may rewrite it to do GL calls or modify the bitmap myself in a next iteration. This one is fun to watch emerge as is, though.
